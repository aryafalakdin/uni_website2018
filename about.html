      <p> It’s pretty hard to describe myself – even harder when you need to be concise! Haha! My name is Arya Falakdin, I’m 23 years old Freelance 3d artist from Sydney. I’ve working in the industry for last 2 years, and during this time I had the time to work for companies like Walt Disney Animation Studios, Blur Studios, Meindbender Animation Studios, Passion Pictures, Marvel Entertainment and many other all around the world… and I love art! Doesn’t matter if it’s digital art, traditional art, 3d or 2d, animation or music… I simply love art. And that passion has always motivated me to keep pushing my limits and to always be looking for more knowledge, improving myself as an artist. One of the most important things that I’ve learned over my 2 years of experience in the 3d industry was that “everyone has something to learn, everyone has something to teach”. This simple sentence works like a mantra for me, it helps me to be more professional and respectful with my teammates, have more appreciation for teamwork and never put my ego before other people’s opinions. I’m a self-taught artist – every skill that I have was developed studying by myself and from my extensive industry experience. I’m responsive, strong-minded, dedicated to my work and most important: I’m adaptive. Learning new tools, pipelines, workflows or techniques was never a problem for me. Everything new to me I face as a new challenge, so when I learn something, I try to apply it to my work immediately, master it and evolve it. </p>
