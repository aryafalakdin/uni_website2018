      <h2><strong>Where are you from? How old are you and how long have you been doing that?</strong></h2>
      <p> I’m born and raised in Sydney, Australia – and still living here! I’m 23 years old and I’m a 3d artist since I was 19,so 12 years ago. In 2016 I lived in greece while I was working at Walt Disney Animation Studios, but when my contract ended I moved back to Sydney.</p>
      <h2><strong>What software do you use?</strong></h2>
      <p> Mainly 3DS Max, but I also work with Maya and know a thing or two about Modo. For rendering I can use V-Ray, Maxwell Render, Arnold Render, Octane, Corona and Modo native render engine. For sculpting I mostly use Zbrush, Substance Painter for Texturing and Photoshop (or After Effects) for post-production. </p>
      <h2><strong>What are your PC specs?</strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Intel i7 4GHz</li>
        <li>2x GTX Titan 12GB</li>
        <li>64GB RAM</li>
        <li>4TB HDD</li>
        <li>1TB SSD</li>
        <li>1500 Watt PSU</li>
        <li>Samsung 4K Display 120Hz</li>
      </ul>
      <p> It’s a cool PC, but for years I used to work with averages PCs (I’ve made Fuurinkazan using only a I3 Dual Core for rendering), so don’t let PC specs be a barrier, because they can dictate how fast, but not how good you work is. =) </p>
      <h2><strong>What you do for living?</strong></h2>
      <p> After a long time working for studios here Sydney, now I work as full-time freelance 3d artist/CG Generalist. So, if you’re looking for someone to execute or supervise, I will be pleased to help! </p>
      <h2><strong>CG Generalist? What are your skills?</strong></h2>
      <p> I can do all the running process for a character development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3D Concept (I can do 2D as well, but I do prefer 3d.)</li>
        <li>Modeling , Look Development and Render.</li>
        <li>Characters for both Cinematic and Games.</li>
        <li>Some TD stuff as rigging (basic) and really basic character animation. I’m also a “problem-solver”, most of the time I’m trying to figure out what went wrong with something. I have +8 years of experience with 3d illustration as well and +1 year as a character modeler for games.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2><strong>Do you work with full animation projects?</strong></h2>
      <p> I can do all the running process, from concept to post production. I can also animate, but isn’t a skill that I feel myself comfortable and for now I prefer to improve it before accepting an animation job, which I’m working on it. =) </p>
      <h2><strong>Where did your learned all that stuff? Did you took classes?</strong></h2>
      <p> I’m a self-taught artist. Everything that I know I learned day by day facing problems to solve at work or looking for new knowledge at Google. </p>
      <h2><strong>Talking about classes, what can I do to get some classes from you?</strong></h2>
      <p> I have some plans to start an online workshop project this year, but dates are TBA. Meanwhile, I also do lectures and comissioned workshops for schools/websites. So, if this is your case, send me a message! =) </p>
      <h2><strong>Are you avaliable for freelance/comissioned works? And for a fulltime job?</strong></h2>
      <p> Sure! I’m always open for new opportunities! =) </p>
      <h2><strong>I sent you an e-mail and you didn’t replied me. Why? ='(</strong></h2>
      <p> Damn, If I made that I’m truly sorry! I always try to reply every message that I get, sometimes it can took months (not because of the amount, just because I’m to lazy to do that), but you can rest assure that I read every message and do my best to reply then! Feel free to find me on Instagram! </p>
      <h2><strong>Any tips for who is starting?</strong></h2>
      <p> Be humble, let the world inspire you and do it for love. Everything else will be a consequence. </p>
